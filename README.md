# PERSIDIAN

Habits is a habit tracking application primarily built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It allows users to track their habits throughout the week with an interactive chart.

Features

Activity Tracking: Initialize with an activity, such as running, and input the hours you spend on this activity each day.
Interactive Chart: Uses the Chart.js library to provide a visual representation of your habits throughout the week.
Real-time Updates: The chart updates in real-time as you input your activity data.
Total Hours Calculation: Calculates the total hours spent on the activity for the week.

Future

App integration that populates the chart
Ability to track your progress against others (in your circle)
Extension into gaming models that incentivise habit streaks

The site currently is in testing and resolves to www.persidian.co.uk via Github Pages

The landing page is www.persidian.com - a combination of two words, persistence + circadian
